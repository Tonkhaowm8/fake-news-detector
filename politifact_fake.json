Aldrin, the second man on the moon, and four others gave accounts of their sightings under strict lab conditions. He, Al Worden, Edgar Mitchell and Gordon Cooper all took part in the study conducted by the Institute of BioAcoustic Biology in Albany, Ohio. Aldrin, 88, claimed he was a spaceship on his way to the moon, adding: \"There was something out there that was close enough to be observed... sort of L-shaped.\" The tests, reportedly more reliable than standard lie detector tests, showed he was telling the truth, the Daily Star reported. Apollo 15 pilot Worden, 85, and Apollo 14's Mitchel also claimed to have seen UFOs while Cooper says he actually tried to chase a cluster of objects. Tests analysing their voice patterns suggested they were also telling the truth about their strange encounters. Aldrin answered questions about his alleged encounter with alien life on a Reddit Q&A with fans last week. In one post he said: \"On Apollo 11 in route to the Moon, I observed a light out the window that appeared to be moving alongside us. \"There were many explanations of what that could be, other than another spacecraft from another country or another world. \"It was either the rocket we had separated from or the four panels that moved away when we extracted the lander from the rocket. \"It was not an alien. Extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence. That's what Carl Sagan said. \"There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies. The probability is almost certain that there is life somewhere in space. \"It was not that remarkable, that special, that unusual, that life here on earth evolved gradually, slowly, to where we are today.\" On July 21, 1969, Neil Armstrong made history by becoming the first person to set foot on the earth\u2019s moon. Upon landing, he is famously quoted as saying: \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Buzz was on the same mission, Apollo 11, as Neil Armstrong and soon followed in his footsteps - making him the second man on the moon. In total, Neil and Buzz were on the lunar surface for only 21 hours, 36 minutes and 21 seconds. Pete Conrad was a moon walker on the Apollo 12 mission, which launched on November 14, 1969. He was partnered by Alan Bean. Also on the Apollo 12 mission, was Alan Bean. He and Pete were on the moon for two days - November 19 and 20, 1969. \u00a9News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF. \"The Sun\", \"Sun\", \"Sun Online\" are registered trademarks or trade names of News Group Newspapers Limited.

Police said a 32-year-old woman had died and that they were attempting to notify her family before releasing more details. Col Martin Kumer, the superintendent of Albemarle-Charlottesville regional jail, told the Guardian that 20-year-old James Fields, of Ohio, had been arrested following the attack on Saturday. \u201cHe has been charged with second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at an accident that resulted in a death,\u201d Kumer said in an email. Donald Trump condemned the \u201cviolence on many sides\u201d, but faced criticism for failing to directly denounce the far-right demonstrators. In a separate incident, two police officers died when their helicopter, which was monitoring the far-right rally, crashed outside Charlottesville. State police said in a statement the helicopter was \u201cassisting public safety resources with the ongoing situation\u201d when it crashed in a wooded area. The pilot, Lieutenant H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-pilot Berke Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene. The deaths came at the end of a day marked by violent clashes between far-right nationalists and people who had come to protest against their occupation of a downtown park containing a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee. Witnesses said those hit by the car were peacefully protesting against the white supremacist rally and footage showed the vehicle crashing into another car, throwing people over the top of it. The photographer Pat Jarrett, who witnessed the incident, said: \u201cA gray Dodge Charger plowed into a sedan and then into a minivan. Bodies flew. People were terrified and screaming. Those closest to it said it was definitely a violent attack. The driver, who people later described as a skinny white guy with a straggly beard, reversed out of there and drove off, the front end of his car all smashed up.\u201d", "Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer tweeted: \u201cI am heartbroken that a life has been lost here.

Responding to the events in Charlottesville from Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump: \u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.\u201d", "But the Republican senator Marco Rubio tweeted that it was important for Trump to describe the events as a \u201cterror attack by white supremacists\u201d. The FBI said it was opening a civil rights investigation into the accident along with the justice department\u2019s civil rights division and the district attorney\u2019s office.

The city\u2019s decision in February to remove the statue drew earlier protests by the \u201calt-right\u201d and the Ku Klux Klan. Riot police cleared the park after almost an hour of clashes. The far-right groups were largely compliant, but had to run the gauntlet of counter-protesters as they walked west along Market Street.After a brief stalemate, a hard core of about 100 far-right protesters moved to a park two miles away and gathered to hear speakers who had been scheduled for the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d event. One of the speakers, the far-right figurehead Richard Spencer, said he had been maced on the way in and lashed out at police and city authorities. \u201cNever in my life have I felt like the government was cracking down on me until today,\u201d said Spencer. \u201cWe came in peace and we were effectively thrown to the wolves.\u201d", "He said that they would not back down from protesting against the statue. When he mentioned Mayor Signer by name, the crowd chanted: \u201cJew! Jew! Jew!\u201d", "Around the park, members of the far right were nursing and treating minor wounds. One of them, who declined to give his name, was bleeding from the head, and claimed to have been struck with an iron bar. Another young man, with a swastika tattoo on his chest and blood on his forehead, told photographers: \u201cIf you take my picture, I\u2019ll cut you. I\u2019m not even kidding.\u201d", "Meanwhile, counter-protesters were trying to stop the far-right groups from entering the park. Some counter-protesters, including many marching under red and black anti-fascist banners, tried to block the streets. This led to altercations with far-right groups, who were seen using chemical weapons, sticks and shields on people. A group of clergy linked arms to block a set of stairs leading into the park. The Rev Seth Wispelwey, of Sojourners United Church of Christ in Charlottesville, said: \u201cWe\u2019re here to counteract white supremacy, and to let people know that it is a system of evil and a system of sin.\u201d", "Steve Thomas, from Lynchburg, Virginia, who also protested against the far-right groups, said: \u201cI think that what we are witnessing here has always been simmering beneath the surface, and now has been emboldened and enabled by the Trump administration\u2019s politics and rhetoric.\u201d", "In February, the city council narrowly voted to remove and sell the Robert Lee statue, and to rename the park in which it stands from Lee Park to Emancipation Park. This was the culmination of a campaign to remove the statue started by a local high school student, Zyahna Bryant. It was part of a wave of such removals of Confederate monuments across the south, which began after Dylann Roof massacred nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina. In response, last May, Richard Spencer led a torchlit white nationalist parade around the park. Then, on 8 July, about 50 members of the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in the park, and were greeted by about 1,000 counter-protesters. The day ended in turmoil after police used tear gas on some counter-protesters following the Klan\u2019s departure, and made 23 arrests.

Update: On Friday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officials who he alleges are involved in these hackings and leaks. You can read about the new breaking indictment at this link. Our original explainer on the hackings, written before the new indictment, is below. Original post: There\u2019s one positively enormous shoe that still hasn\u2019t dropped in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 campaign: an indictment about all those hacked emails. The hacking and release of leading political figures\u2019 emails is the most visible election intervention attributed to Russia\u2019s government. And it\u2019s long been one of the leading, and perhaps the leading, possibility about just what \u201ccollusion\u201d between Donald Trump\u2019s team and the Russians might have involved. That\u2019s not mere speculation. We\u2019ve gradually learned of not one but six times Trump associates at least tried to get involved with either Russian-provided dirt, hacked Democratic emails, or WikiLeaks. We don\u2019t yet know whether these furtive contacts resulted in anything of significance \u2014 but one of these advisers, George Papadopoulos, has already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the matter and has begun cooperating with Mueller\u2019s team. These hacks were crimes, victimizing many hundreds of Americans (those who had their documents stolen, and those who corresponded with them). The operation was more wide-ranging than many remember, targeting not just John Podesta and the DNC but many other people and groups. It wasn\u2019t just emails stolen, either \u2014 posted material ranged from Democratic Party turnout data that a Republican operative thought was \u201cprobably worth millions of dollars\u201d to even a purported picture of Michelle Obama\u2019s passport. No charges have been filed in the matter \u2014 yet. But some are likely coming. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the US has identified \u201cmore than six members of the Russian government\u201d involved in the DNC hacks. And the Daily Beast wrote that investigators have identified a specific Russian intelligence officer behind \u201cGuccifer 2.0,\u201d a leading figure in the hacks. Mueller is now overseeing the probe. To understand what happened in 2016, we have to understand the hackings. And though some mysteries remain, much of the complex story has gradually been pieced together by journalists and cybersecurity experts. The consequences, of course, unfolded in plain sight during the campaign itself. The media often shorthands the 2016 hack story as: Russians hacked Podesta and the DNC\u2019s email accounts, and WikiLeaks then posted those hacked emails publicly. The full story is more complex. Let\u2019s start at the beginning. Between March 2015 and May 2016, a group of hackers went on a phishing expedition. The \u201cbaited lines\u201d they cast out were at least 19,000 malicious emails that resembled the one below:", "These emails were designed to look as if they were coming from Google. But they were in fact designed to trick people into clicking through and entering their login credentials \u2014 delivering them right into the hackers\u2019 hands. According to a later Associated Press analysis of a report by the information security firm SecureWorks, at least 573 of the more than 4,700 email addresses targeted were American. They included many US government officials, military officials, intelligence officials, and defense contractors. Particularly beginning in March and April 2016, these targets began to include many Democrats as well. Per the AP, more than 130 Democratic accounts were sent these malicious links, compared to just \u201ca handful\u201d of Republican accounts. Podesta and several Clinton staffers \u2014 along with former Secretary of State Colin Powell, retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, and others \u2014 had their accounts successfully compromised. (We know all this because the hackers used the link-shortening tool Bitly to do their work and accidentally left their activity publicly viewable.)", "Russia was eventually blamed for the phishing expedition, for several reasons. For one, SecureWorks concluded the particular malware used in this campaign was tied to a hacking group that outside researchers had been tracking for some time \u2014 a group they thought to be linked the GRU, Russia\u2019s foreign military intelligence agency. We don\u2019t know what the secretive hacking group calls itself, but various cybersecurity researchers had given it several names: Iron Twilight, APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) 28, Pawn Storm, and \u2014 most famously \u2014 \u201cFancy Bear.\u201d", "Circumstantial evidence also suggests a Russian-tied culprit. For instance, the phishers were extremely focused on Ukraine \u2014 at least 545 targeted email accounts were from there, comparable to the number of American targets. These included Ukraine\u2019s president and many other top government officials, who are hostile to Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime. The Russians targeted, meanwhile, were generally critics of Putin\u2019s government and journalists. Another interesting detail, per the AP, is that more than 95 percent of the malicious links were created between the hours of 9 am and 6 pm, Monday to Friday \u2014 Moscow time. Around April 2016, as this phishing campaign increasingly began to target Democrats, material was also taken from the DNC. The firm Crowdstrike attributed this as a hack from Fancy Bear, citing the malware used, and other firms agreed with this assessment. These firms also concluded that a separate group of Russian-tied hackers (dubbed \u201cCozy Bear\u201d) had been in the DNC\u2019s systems for much longer, since all the way back in the summer of 2015. The precise mechanisms of how the DNC was breached remain somewhat murky. But Fancy Bear\u2019s phishing campaign did send out malicious links to nine DNC email accounts in March and April 2016. And as we\u2019ll soon see, hacked DNC material ended up in the same place as hacked material from Podesta and others. A January 2017 US intelligence report would later specifically blame Russia\u2019s GRU \u2014 the agency thought to be behind Fancy Bear \u2014 for taking \u201clarge volumes of data from the DNC.\u201d", "As striking as all this may seem, though, government-backed hacking is far from unusual. The US does it. Our allies do it. Our rivals do it. China was said to have hacked Barack Obama and John McCain\u2019s presidential campaigns in 2008 and was then tied to a massive theft of federal data in 2015. Foreign intelligence agencies trying to peek into political activities seemed to be something that just, well, happened all the time. What came next in 2016, however, was a jarring departure from these norms \u2014 the hacked information began to be posted publicly, in massive amounts. The backdrop to all of this was the US presidential election \u2014 the first series of primaries and caucuses took place in February and early March. The surprisingly Russia-friendly Donald Trump emerged as the clear leader in the Republican contest, over his Putin-critical rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, with whom Putin\u2019s regime had long had chilly relations, emerged as the favorite for the Democratic nomination over Bernie Sanders. It was around this point \u2014 in mid-March 2016 \u2014 that the phishing campaign began to particularly target many Democrats\u2019 and Clinton campaign staffers\u2019 email accounts, according to SecureWorks\u2019 analysis. There were several other events that, in retrospect, are either relevant or at the very least intriguing:", "Throughout all this time, there was no public indication that the phishing campaign, or the hacking of the DNC and other campaign figures\u2019 emails, had taken place. Just days later, that would change. On June 12, 2016, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange dropped a bombshell. \u201cWe have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton,\u201d he announced, during a British television interview. \u201cWe have emails pending publication.\u201d", "WikiLeaks \u2014 a nonprofit launched back in 2006 by Assange, an Australian activist \u2014 had previously been most famous for posting a plethora of internal US military documents about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (including video of a deadly airstrike) and more than 250,000 diplomatic cables from the US State Department \u2014 leaked by Chelsea Manning. Assange was then accused of rape and sexual assault in Sweden, and he sought political asylum from Ecuador. He has been holed up in the nation\u2019s London embassy since June 2012. Assange\u2019s announcement was the first public indication that Democrats would soon be plagued by leaked internal emails. So two days after that, the DNC, which had learned of the hacking of its systems and hired Crowdstrike to respond, decided to get in front of what it feared was coming. The committee told the Washington Post that it had been hacked \u2014 by, it claimed, the Russian government. Crowdstrike\u2019s CEO put up a blog post explaining why he identified Russia as the culprit. Yet the next day, June 15, things got even weirder \u2014 because that is when \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d arrived on the scene. (The name, a portmanteau of \u201cGucci\u201d and \u201cLucifer,\u201d is an homage to the original Guccifer, the jailed Romanian hacker Marcel Leher Lazar, who\u2019d broken into high-profile Americans\u2019 email accounts.)", "In a Wordpress post, the new Guccifer said that Crowdstrike was quite wrong about the DNC hack, which he said was carried out by him, \u201ca lone hacker.\u201d (\u201cFuck CrowdStrike!!!\u201d he wrote.) He said that he\u2019d given \u201cthe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails\u201d that he\u2019d stolen, to WikiLeaks. (WikiLeaks has refused to confirm that he was its source.) He also began to post several documents he claimed were from the DNC server. Almost immediately, journalists pointed to inconsistencies in Guccifer\u2019s story and linguistic tics to suggest he was Russian \u2014 or more than one Russian. (US intelligence agencies would eventually say Russia\u2019s GRU was behind the persona, and the Daily Beast recently reported that the account\u2019s user once slipped up and neglected to mask his identity through a VPN \u2014 allowing investigators to match a particular Russian intelligence officer to that Guccifer 2.0 login.)", "Yet what Guccifer had access to was clearly broader than just the DNC. None of the first documents he posted showed up in WikiLeaks\u2019 DNC email dump, and in fact, many of them eventually showed up in John Podesta\u2019s emails, which were released much later. Additionally, on June 27, Guccifer emailed the Smoking Gun\u2019s William Bastone a link to a password-protected post on DCLeaks.com that contained phished emails and documents from Clinton staffer Sarah Hamilton. (DCLeaks had not yet publicly posted any material related to the election.)", "On July 6, Guccifer 2.0 posted his first documents that would eventually be found in the DNC emails. The New Yorker\u2019s Raffi Khatchadourian speculates, based on some comments Guccifer made to journalists at the time, that Guccifer or his handlers were frustrated that WikiLeaks was taking too long to actually post the DNC material and were threatening to spoil Assange\u2019s exclusive. (A week later, Guccifer would send documents to the Hill\u2019s Joe Uchill, writing that he was doing so because the press was \u201cgradually forget[ing] about me,\u201d and complained that WikiLeaks was \u201cplaying for time.\u201d)", "All the while, Assange and WikiLeaks were working to prepare their database of DNC emails, with the apparent goal of publishing them before the Democratic convention began in late July. It\u2019s unclear how they set that goal. Assange would later tell Khatchadourian that he originally had a deadline of July 18 to release them, but \u201cwe were given a little more time.\u201d (It\u2019s unclear, though, who gave him more time, and Assange later disputed the accuracy of the recorded quote.)", "Finally, on July 22 \u2014 the Friday before the convention \u2014 WikiLeaks posted those thousands of DNC emails and attachments online. They revealed that many DNC members privately spoke of Bernie Sanders with disdain, drove DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other top staffers to resign, and overall made an ugly start for the Democratic convention. Though Assange remained mum on his source, Guccifer 2.0 jubilantly claimed credit in a tweet:", "@wikileaks published #DNCHack docs I'd given them!!! #HillaryClinton #DonaldTrump #BernieSanders #Guccifer2 https://t.co/TXFAySUKWw", "The DNC leaks proved to be just the beginning. News soon broke that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) had also been hacked, and on August 12, DCCC documents started showing up on Guccifer\u2019s Wordpress site. Guccifer also sent the DCCC\u2019s internal turnout model data to Florida Republican Party operative Aaron Nevins, who was positively thrilled to receive it. \u201cHoly fuck man I don\u2019t think you realize what you gave me,\u201d Nevins wrote in a DM. \u201cThis is probably worth millions of dollars.\u201d Nevins soon put it online on his anonymously run blog. Then DCLeaks got in the game. On August 12, the site posted a few emails from some little-known Republican state party aides, and from campaign advisers to Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), both of whom were known as Russia hawks. In September, the site\u2019s anonymous administrators sent Colin Powell\u2019s phished emails to reporters, revealing his candid assessments of both Clinton (\u201cgreedy\u201d) and Trump (\u201cnational disgrace\u201d). DCLeaks then posted phished emails from Ian Mellul, an Obama White House staffer who had volunteered for Clinton. The Mellul documents included a picture of Michelle Obama\u2019s passport and a months-old audio file in which Hillary Clinton said Sanders\u2019s young supporters were \u201cliving in their parents\u2019 basement.\u201d Longtime Clinton ally Capricia Marshall\u2019s phished emails came next. Many of these disclosures caused brief stirs, but what everyone was really waiting for was the next WikiLeaks dump. Roger Stone, the Trump associate, claimed that he knew Assange had something huge on the way and speculated it would involve the Clinton Foundation. Assange himself told Fox News back on August 24 that his team had \u201cthousands of pages of material\u201d and was \u201cworking around the clock\u201d to prepare it for publication. By early October, there was still nothing from WikiLeaks, but Stone continued to hype an imminent release, saying \u201can intermediary\u201d who\u2019d met with Assange said \u201cthe mother lode is coming Wednesday.\u201d", "The \u201cmother lode\u201d instead came two days later, on Friday, October 7, when WikiLeaks posted its first batch of Podesta\u2019s emails. The site would continue to post them, in batches, up through the election. Earlier on that very same day, the US government officially attributed the hacking effort to the Russian government, and the Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape hit the news. In the end, the 2016 election was close, decided by just over 1 percentage point in three Electoral College states. And whether or not the email leaks were sufficient to swing the outcome, they certainly were effective at keeping the words \u201cHillary Clinton\u201d and \u201cemails\u201d in the headlines throughout the campaign\u2019s final stretch. During the campaign, it was clear enough that Trump was unusually friendly to Russia, and that the Russian government interventions seemed aimed at trying to help his electoral chances at the expense of Hillary Clinton. But after the election, more and more attention became devoted to whether Trump associates and Putin\u2019s government coordinated to intervene in the campaign in some way. And on March 20, 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed the FBI was investigating just that topic. No one has produced a smoking gun demonstrating clear involvement just yet. But this isn\u2019t mere idle speculation, either \u2014 there are at least six instances in which Trump associates tried to get Russian dirt or communicated with hacking and leaking figures. The first of them was what initiated the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia to begin with:", "#business pic.twitter.com/NvlHAeUKdV", "1) The Papadopoulos tip: Fancy Bear\u2019s phishing campaign targeted Clinton staffers and Democrats in large numbers in March and April 2016, but the hacks remained publicly unknown for months afterward. Yet it was very early indeed \u2014 on April 26 \u2014 that Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos got his tip about what was coming. As described above, the tip was from a source Papadopoulos understood to have Russian government connections, professor Joseph Mifsud. Mifsud specifically said he\u2019d gained his information from traveling to Moscow and meeting high-level officials there. And he said Russia had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton \u2014 and, specifically, thousands of emails. We don\u2019t yet know whether he told others in the Trump campaign about what he\u2019d heard. But it seems highly likely that he did. He was a young adviser eager to impress campaign higher-ups. And we already know he drunkenly bragged about his inside info to an Australian diplomat a few weeks later. (The Australians later told the FBI, which led the bureau to open the investigation.)", "In any case, Papadopoulos was arrested last summer for making false statements to FBI investigators, cut a plea deal, and began cooperating with investigators. So whatever he did do with his tip, Mueller likely now knows it. 2) The Trump Tower meeting: It was on June 3, 2016 \u2014 a little more than a month after Papadopoulos\u2019s tip, but still before any news broke about Democrats having been hacked \u2014 that publicist Rob Goldstone emailed an acquaintance of his, Donald Trump Jr. Goldstone described some news from his clients Aras and Emin Agalarov, a father-son pair of real estate developers who\u2019d done business with the Trumps:", "The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin. Don Jr. enthusiastically accepted the offer, and Goldstone arranged a meeting six days later, on June 9. The Trump delegation included Don Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner. They met Goldstone, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, Agalarov company executive Ike Kaveladze, Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, and translator Anatoli Samochornov. Once the existence of the meeting became public, all parties involved claimed it was a dud, resulting in nothing of consequence. But the timing of the meeting is strange. Three days later, Assange announced he\u2019d received emails related to Hillary Clinton. Two days after that, the DNC announced it had been hacked and blamed Russia. Goldstone saw an article about that and emailed it to Emin and Kaveladze, writing that the news was \u201ceerily weird\u201d considering what they\u2019d just discussed at the Trump Tower meeting. Guccifer 2.0 began posting the day after that. 3) The Cambridge Analytica CEO\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks: Cambridge Analytica is the Steve Bannon-tied firm that did digital work for the Trump campaign and has been in the news of late. And last year, we learned that Cambridge\u2019s CEO, Alexander Nix, had twice contacted WikiLeaks on the topic of hacked emails. Nix says that in \u201cearly June,\u201d after he learned of Assange\u2019s claims to have Hillary Clinton-related emails, he reached out to Julian Assange to ask for an advance look at those emails. He says Assange turned him down. Then in August, after Assange had posted the DNC emails, Nix emailed Cambridge employees to say that he\u2019d recently reached out to Assange again, offering help at organizing the DNC material on WikiLeaks. He said he hadn\u2019t yet heard back. Both Nix and Assange have said these overtures didn\u2019t go anywhere. 4) Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks: Then, separately, Donald Trump Jr. had some communications with WikiLeaks through the group\u2019s Twitter account toward the end of the campaign. As best we know, WikiLeaks began the communication, DMing Don Jr. to tell him that they had guessed the password to a new \u201cPAC run anti-Trump site,\u201d PutinTrump.org, that was about to launch. \u201cAny comments?\u201d the group asked. Trump Jr. answered: \u201cOff the record I don\u2019t know who that is but I\u2019ll ask around. Thanks.\u201d", "Then on October 3, 2016, WikiLeaks DMed Don Jr. again, asking him to \u201ccomment on\u201d or \u201cpush\u201d a story that Hillary Clinton had once said she wanted to \u201cjust drone\u201d Assange. Don Jr. answered, \u201cAlready did that earlier today. It\u2019s amazing what she can get away with.\u201d", "He then followed up with a question: \u201cWhat\u2019s behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about?\u201d This was at the height of chatter that WikiLeaks had a major batch of anti-Clinton material ready. However, there is no indication that WikiLeaks answered this question from Don Jr. or gave him any advance information that it was Podesta\u2019s emails that were coming. The group sent him a couple more messages, but there are no more known responses from Don Jr. 5) Roger Stone\u2019s several contacts with both Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks: Roger Stone is a longtime Republican operative with a reputation for dirty tricks and a decades-long relationship with Donald Trump. Stone was only an official Trump campaign adviser briefly, departing the operation in early August 2015 after clashing with other staffers. But he remained in Trump\u2019s orbit and, to some extent, in communication with the candidate himself afterward. Both in public and in private, Stone was fixated on the hackings and leaks. One associate of Stone\u2019s claimed to the Washington Post that at some point in the spring of 2016, before news of the hackings broke, Stone said he\u2019d learned from Julian Assange that WikiLeaks had obtained emails that would hurt Democrats. (Stone denies this.)", "The initial leaks from Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks were posted in June and July. On August 4, Stone emailed fellow ex-Trump adviser and longtime associate Sam Nunberg:  \u201cI dined with Julian Assange last night,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal. (Stone says this was a joke and flight records prove he wasn\u2019t in London then.)", "The day after that email, on August 5, Stone penned a Breitbart article in which he took Guccifer\u2019s story about being a lone hacker who stole the DNC emails at face value and argued Russia probably wasn\u2019t responsible. He also tweeted that \u201cJulian Assange is a hero.\u201d", "Three days later, on August 8, Stone started publicly claiming to have inside information. \u201cI actually have communicated with Assange,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but there\u2019s no telling what the October surprise may be.\u201d", "A few days after that, Stone began tweeting at, and eventually DMing with, Guccifer 2.0 (who, again, has reportedly been identified as a Russian intelligence officer). Some of these DMs later leaked, leading Stone to post what he claimed was their full exchange. The posted messages are mainly friendly chitchat and not particularly substantive. On August 21, Stone tweeted an odd prediction: \u201cTrust me, it will soon the Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel. #CrookedHillary.\u201d Many would later point to this \u2014 which came months before the Podesta emails became public \u2014 and ask whether Stone had advance knowledge of the Podesta email leak. (Stone himself would later claim that since this came in the midst of a scandal surrounding Stone\u2019s old friend Paul Manafort\u2019s Ukraine work, he was merely predicting \u201cPodesta\u2019s business dealings would be exposed.\u201d)", "As October began, Stone took on a new role \u2014 as WikiLeaks\u2019 hype man. He again claimed inside knowledge, saying a \u201cfriend\u201d of his met with Assange and learned \u201cthe mother lode is coming Wednesday.\u201d He tweeted: \u201cWednesday @HillaryClinton is done. #Wikileaks.\u201d And when nothing came on Wednesday, Stone tweeted, \u201cLibs thinking Assange will stand down are wishful thinking. Payload coming. #Lockthemup.\u201d Assange published the Podesta emails two days later. Immediately, there were questions about whether the garrulous operative had been involved, which eventually spurred WikiLeaks to tweet that the group \u201chas never communicated with Roger Stone.\u201d The Atlantic later reported that Stone DMed the WikiLeaks Twitter account afterward, complaining that they were \u201cattacking\u201d him. \u201cThe false claims of association are being used by the democrats to undermine the impact of our publications,\u201d WikiLeaks responded. \u201cDon\u2019t go there if you don\u2019t want us to correct you.\u201d Stone shot back: \u201cHa! The more you \u2018correct\u2019 me the more people think you\u2019re lying. Your operation leaks like a sieve. You need to figure out who your friends are.\u201d", "What to make of all this? Stone was obviously in contact with two of the key leakers, and his own public statements show that at one point he wanted people to think he had an inside line on WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. However, he\u2019s repeatedly denied any inside knowledge or involvement, and we haven\u2019t seen any clear evidence that he truly had such knowledge. In any case, we might learn more from Mueller\u2019s probe soon enough. \u201cThey want me to testify against Roger,\u201d Sam Nunberg said this year, referring to the special counsel\u2019s team. \u201cThey want me to say that Roger was going around telling people he was colluding with Julian Assange.\u201d", "6) Peter Smith\u2019s hunt for Hillary\u2019s deleted emails: Last but certainly not least, there is one more email-related subplot to the 2016 campaign \u2014 and it\u2019s a weird one. This one involves a separate set of emails: When word got out that Hillary Clinton had used a personal email account for all her work at the State Department, she agreed to hand over the work-related emails on that account to government investigators. But it turned out that she had previously deemed about 32,000 emails (about half of the total) to be \u201cpersonal\u201d rather than work-related, and deleted them. Conservatives like longtime Republican operative Peter Smith didn\u2019t take Clinton\u2019s explanation for why she deleted the emails at face value and questioned whether they could have contained scandalous behavior or criminal evidence. Their number included GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 [Hillary Clinton] emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said at a July 27, 2016, press conference. \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let\u2019s see if that happens. That will be next.\u201d", "It was around this time that Smith began an unusual project. He assumed that Clinton\u2019s email server had been hacked and that her emails must be out there somewhere, on the \u201cdark web.\u201d So he reached out to computer experts and conservative activists, hoping to assemble a team that would track down those emails. Smith didn\u2019t work for the Trump campaign. But he is said to have repeatedly claimed to be in contact with Michael Flynn, who was advising Trump. One recruiting document Smith sent to cybersecurity expert Matt Tait contained the subheader \u201cTrump Campaign (in coordination to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure).\u201d It then listed several names: Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Sam Clovis, Flynn, and Lisa Nelson. (Bannon and Conway have denied any involvement. The other three haven\u2019t commented.)", "Eventually, Smith gave his version of what happened to the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Shane Harris. He said his team found five hacker groups who said they had Clinton\u2019s emails, of which two seemed to be Russian. \u201cWe knew the people who had these were probably around the Russian government,\u201d Smith said. However, he went on, he couldn\u2019t determine whether the emails were authentic, so he ended up just advising the hackers to give them to WikiLeaks. No such emails have ever surfaced. Smith \u2014 81 years old and in poor health \u2014 killed himself in May 2017, 10 days after speaking to Harris. Smith\u2019s effort appears to have failed. But Smith admitted he had tried to get stolen documents from groups he understood to be Russian government-tied. And then there is the question of Michael Flynn\u2019s role \u2014 particularly since, per Harris\u2019s sources, there are intelligence reports that say Russian hackers discussed how they could get leaked emails into Flynn\u2019s hands. Much remains murky about this situation, but Flynn is cooperating with Mueller\u2019s team as part of a plea deal, so the special counsel likely now knows whatever he does. Last November, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Aruna Viswanatha and Del Quentin Wilber reported that the Justice Department had identified more than six Russian government officials involved in the DNC hack and was considering bringing charges. Interestingly, though, the report claimed that special counsel Robert Mueller had chosen not to take over the DNC hack investigation because it was \u201crelatively technical\u201d and had already \u201cbeen under way for nearly a year.\u201d", "That appears to have since changed. Both NBC News and the Daily Beast reported in March that Mueller had now taken charge of the email hacking investigation. And the Washington Post reported in January that Mueller had added \u201ca veteran cyber prosecutor,\u201d Ryan Dickey, to his team. (Credit to Marcy Wheeler for flagging this point.)", "So it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that Mueller will bring some charges related to the email hackings. And judging by his past indictments, he\u2019ll also use them to tell a story about what exactly happened, to the extent he can. There is, after all, a good deal we still don\u2019t know \u2014  for instance, how, exactly, did the DNC and Podesta emails get from the hackers to WikiLeaks?", "It\u2019s important to remember that this is all just what we know about \u2014 there could be more that is still not public. It is certainly possible that several of their contacts with real or purported leakers and hackers listed above went nowhere, but it\u2019s a bit harder to believe that all six of those separate contacts resulted in nothing of consequence. Mueller has already gotten three people tied to Trump to plead guilty and cooperate with the investigation. What is he getting from George Papadopoulos, who got the earliest known tip that the Russians hacked the emails? What is he getting from Michael Flynn, who may have been tied to Peter Smith\u2019s effort to get Clinton emails from Russian hackers? What was he getting from Rick Gates, who was Paul Manafort\u2019s right-hand man both before and during the campaign?", "All three men have pleaded guilty, and we haven\u2019t seen any of the fruits of their cooperation yet. They may be providing Mueller information about the hacked emails, and they may not. But it\u2019s safe to say they\u2019re telling Mueller a good deal that\u2019s of interest \u2014 and eventually, we will find out what.

John Kasich vetoed the so-called \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman\u2019s life or preventing the \u201csubstantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d", "\u201cAt the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,\u201d Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. \u201cWomen are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, I\u2019m sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.\u201d", "He continued, \u201cOur mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And there\u2019s one very simple reason why I did it. That\u2019s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they\u2019re supposed to be closed, if she doesn\u2019t have the foresight to make sure she doesn\u2019t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.\u201d", "\u201cA woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we\u2019re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child \u2013 a being who\u2019s done no wrong and only exists as its mother\u2019s mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter?\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.\u201d", "\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you another thing \u2013 as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state.

Since then, it has increasingly been added to a wide variety of products. In a culture that has become more germ-obsessed than ever, companies have marketed products of all kinds to keep germs at bay. From airports to grocery stores to gyms and many more public spaces, there's a dispenser ready to give you a dose of anti-bacterial goo. The more we see these \"stations\", the more likely we feel the need for a bacteria-killing \"fix\". With strains like swine flu causing great panic, it seemed reasonable that people would resort to adding more and more antibacterial products to their exposed skin and cleaning routine. But why not stand behind the old tried and true method of a good 20 second hand wash at the sink? According to the American Medical Association (AMA), there is no evidence that suggests that using antibacterial soap works any more effectively than soap and water. What is Triclosan?", "Triclosan is a synthetic chemical with antimicrobial properties which destroy or inhibit the growth of microorganismssuch as bacteria or fungi. When triclosan was first introduced in the early 70's for use in hospitals, it was a good thing, as it is crucial to keep medical instruments sterile. However, over the last decade, with the rapid increase in the use of triclosan products, the chemical is becoming ubiquitous. Where is Triclosan used?This chemical is used in a wide variety of household products including soaps, toothpaste, cosmetics, deodorant, personal care products, dish detergent, first-aid, kitchenware, toys and even workout clothing! That's a long list when the original intention was just meant for the hospital room. Marketed under names like \"Microban\" that promises to keep household goods like cutting boards, garden hoses, workout clothes and computer keyboards free of bacteria and \"BioFresh\" for antimicrobial socks that keep your feet odor free. Why is Triclosan harmful?Triclosan is a known endocrine disruptor and a suspected carcinogen.There is good reason to believe that the over use of products with triclosan has contributed to bacterial resistance in the same way we are cautioned against the use of antibiotics. The persistent nature that is connected to the use of triclosan being washed down our drains daily and affecting water life. Triclosan is also lipophilic, which means it can bioaccumulate in your fat for long periods of time, and as reported byScientific American, triclosan is now detectable in human breast milk, blood, and urine samples. Environmental Health Perspectives (EHP) found the chemical in 75% of urine samples tested for a studyfocused on triclosan. And furthermore, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention detected triclosan in 58% of US waterways. According to the FDA,\"Animal studies have shown that triclosan alters hormone regulation. Other studies in bacteria have raised the possibility that triclosan contributes to making bacteria resistant to antibiotics. In light of these studies, the FDA is engaged in an ongoing scientific and regulatory review of this ingredient.\" Regarding the possible health impacts of triclosan, the F.D.A. also acknowledged, \"valid concerns about the effect of repetitive daily human exposure to these antiseptic ingredients.\u201d", "Triclosan safety is currently under review by the F.D.A. and the E.P.A.The Environmental Protection Agency has also previously indicated that because of the amount of research being planned and currently in progress, it will undertake another comprehensive review of triclosan beginning in 2013.

Jose Melena was performing maintenance in a 35-foot-long oven at the company's Santa Fe Springs plant before dawn Oct. 11, 2012, when a co-worker, who mistakenly believed Melena was in the bathroom, filled the pressure cooker with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and it was turned on. When a supervisor noticed Melena, 62, was missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker, which reached a temperature of 270 degrees, was turned off and opened. The company, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death. The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require implementing a safety plan, rules for workers entering confined spaces, and a procedure to keep machinery or equipment turned off if someone's working on it. Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, and Florez, 42, of Whittier, could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges, prosecutors said. Bumble Bee Foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. Prosecutions of workplace violations are uncommon \u2014 even in fatalities.

Horrifying video captured by a student shows lifeless victims as teens were rescued by police and ushered out of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Students and staff barricaded themselves inside classrooms - with one group hiding in a closet as pupils cried in terror - as the shooter carried out the Valentine's Day massacre with an assault rifle despite previous warning signs. In the aftermath, one traumatised survivor described how \"there was blood everywhere\" after bullets were fired through classroom windows as the gunman stalked the sprawling campus. Teens posted disturbing photos and videos on social media, with one showing students hiding under desks and screaming as barrage of gunshots echo through the building. The suspected gunman, Nikolas Cruz, was charged on Thursday with 17 counts of premeditated murder, with the victims including an assistant football coach who gave his life to protect students. Today he appeared in court for the first time since the atrocity in Florida and will be remanded in custody. Dressed in orange overalls, he bowed his head as the charge was read out to him. A judge told him: \"I have something very important to tell you. You are charged with some very serious crimes.\"", "He was told he would be \"held without bond until further order\". His lawyer Melissa McNeill said today after the hearing: \"He's a broken human being, he's a broken child. \"The sadness this community is feeling, I mean my children go to school in this community. I feel horrible for these families. \"And Mr Cruz feels that pain.\" All 17 families have been notified of the loss of their loved ones, police said in a briefing today. The victims included students Jaime Guttenburg, Alaina Petty, 14, Martin Duque,14, Alyssa Al Hadeff, 15, Gina Montalto, 14, and Nick Dworet, 18. Luke Hoyer, Carmen Schentrup, Meadow Pollack, 18, Joaquin Oliver, 17, Cara Loughran, Peter Wang, 15, and Alex Schachter were also killed. Aaron Feis, 37, staff member Chris Hixon, 49, and science teacher Scott Beigel also were among the victims. The FBI has now launched an \"extensive review\" into how the 2017 tip into Nikolas Cruz was handled. It has also emerged that Cruz particpated in activities of white nationalist militia. In a press briefing today, Broward County Sheriff said sadly there were copycat threats made at other schools today and they would be taking all of these seriously and would respond in full. Officials in a press briefing today also revealed there were still bodies in the school. Chief Scott Israel said today: \"There are some bodies that are still in the school.\" He said that \"today is the day of mourning\" after many lives were lost in the horrific incident. On the investigation he said: \"We are not going to leave any stone unturned. \"We will interview every single student or person in that school who may know something. \"Law enforcement will do everything we can to make sure this person is convicted of all charges. We will make sure justice is served.\" Mr Israel later added: \"What about the rights of people who go to school with book bags - don't they have the right to be protected?\" He also called people in the community \"our eyes and ears\" and said \"right now, if you know anybody, this raises a red flag, don't just think about calling us, call us. \"If there's something in your gut that tells you there's something not right with this person, please say something.\" In the press briefing today, Governor Rick Scott said: \"We need to make sure this never happens again.\" He said: \"If somebody is mentally ill, they should not have access to a gun.\" Seventeen students and adults were killed and more than a dozen others were hospitalised in Wednesday afternoon's atrocity allegedly carried out by former student Cruz, described by ex-classmates as a \"troubled\" and depressed loner who was \"crazy about guns\" and had talked about shooting pupils. Students had predicted Cruz would become a school shooter due to previous threats, his obsession with guns and knives and his unusual behaviour, it was claimed. Police said the 19-year-old had previously been expelled from the school for disciplinary reasons, and returned with an AR-15 rifle - the same type of firearm used in many other massacres - plus a significant amount of ammunition and smoke bombs. The gun was legally purchased, it was claimed as the motive for the attack - the ninth-deadliest mass shooting in modern US history - remained a mystery. The atrocity began at about 2.30pm, with police claiming Cruz pulled the fire alarm and shot victims as they left classrooms before he blended in with pupils - pretending to be one of the terrified teens - and left the campus within about 25 minutes. In the video showing terrified students fleeing after shots had already been fired, pupils scream and cry in a classroom where police crouch over a body on the floor. An injured girl is carried out of the room by police and her classmates follow behind her and the officers after someone says \"let's go, come on\". There are loud screams as students - including an injured boy grimacing and clutching his shoulder - pass bodies in a corridor and they are urged to \"run\" to safety. Student Geovanni Vilsant, 15, told the Miami Herald that he heard gunfire when he was in a Spanish classroom and then saw three bodies on the floor as he fled the school. He added: \u201cThere was blood everywhere. They weren't moving.\" A female student told Fox News of the distressing things she saw as police escorted her out. She said: \"The police came through the hallway to get us and in the hallway, I saw a big pile of blood, like, kind of smeared as if they were dragged away, and I saw two girls probably dead in the hallway. \"And then, coming down the stairs, there was some more blood and outside the building there was another guy \u2013 I think it was a teacher \u2013 who was, [I\u2019m] pretty sure was dead.\" Student Rebecca Bogart, who was in Holocaust class, told the newspaper that bullets shattered a classroom window and teens ducked for cover. Rebecca, 17, said she got onto the floor and hid under a teacher's desk. She added: \u201cFour kids in my class were hurt. There was blood everywhere. I\u2019m so glad to be living right now. \"I knew what gunshots sounded like, but not that loud or extreme. It smelled smoky.\u201d", "Sarah Crescitelli hid in a theatre class bathroom and sent a text message to her parents reading: \u201cIf I don\u2019t make it I love you and I appreciated everything you did for me.\u201d", "Cruz allegedly wore a gas mask and tossed smoke bombs into a corridor before pulling the fire alarm and shooting people as they ran through the haze. There was confusion when the alarm went off, as students and staff had practiced a drill earlier in the day. The gunman went through corridors all over the campus, shooting more victims before leaving and blending in with pupils as they fled, it was claimed. The local school superintendent said it's believed Cruz took an Uber car to the campus. Cruz was allegedly carrying the gun in a duffel bag and had brought extra clothing with him, it was reported. Student Matthew Walker, 17, told ABC 17 that the suspect was known to show off guns and knives. The student said: \"He was going class to class just shooting at random kids. Everything he posts (on social media) is about weapons. It's sick.\" Another student, Eddie Bonilla, told CBS Miami that other students \"knew it was going to be him\" The student said: \"A lot of people were saying it was going to be him. \"A lot of kids threw jokes around saying that he was going to be the one to shoot up the school. \"It turns out that everyone predicted it. That's crazy.\" The rampage began shortly before lessons were due to end for the day at the school in Broward County, about 45 miles north of Miami. Tales of heroism began to emerge in the hours that followed. School football coach and security guard Aaron Feis, 37, was fatally injured when he threw himself in front of pupils to shield them from the killer's bullets. The football team confirmed his death on Thursday, writing on Twitter: \"It is with Great sadness that our Football Family has learned about the death of Aaron Feis. \"He was our Assistant Football Coach and security guard. He selflessly shielded students from the shooter when he was shot. \"He died a hero and he will forever be in our hearts and memories.\" Language arts teacher Melissa Falkowski hid 19 of her students in a classroom closet as the gunman went through the school. She climbed in after them and they hid from the suspect until it was safe to come out. In the aftermath, Ms Falkowski hit out at the US government and society for failing to prevent the massacre. She told CNN: \"This is the worst nightmare that could ever happen to you.\" She added: \"We\u2019ve trained the kids what to do, and the frustration is that we did everything that we were supposed to do... and still have to have so many casualties.\" Profiles of the victims, including Mr Feis, were also starting to emerge on Thursday, as students from nearby schools returned to lessons under increased security. Student Jaime Guttenberg, 17, was confirmed dead after her parents, Fred and Jennifer, were unable to contact her amid the chaos and launched a desperate bid to find her. Mr Guttenberg posted on Facebok saying his son Jesse had escaped unharmed but added: \"We cannot reach Jaime. \"If anyone has a child who saw or spoke to Jaime please call me.\" The parents were later given the heartbreaking news that their daughter was among the dead. Her cousin Marc Pollack posted a tribute on Facebook, writing: \"This is a picture of our sweet cousin Jaime who was senselessly and tragically killed today at Stoneman Douglas High School. \"My heart is broken from the loss of this awesome young girl and the pain that our entire family is enduring.\" Terrified students ran out of the building, while others took refuge inside as bursts of gunfire rang out. Staff and students got on the floor in locked classrooms, with reports that the gunman shot through windows or doors. Hannah Siren, 14, who was in maths class, told the Orlando Sentinel: \"The people next door to us must have not locked their door.They all got shot.\" Student Alexa Miednik said she briefly spoke to Cruz as she and others rushed outside after the fire alarm went off and gunshots were heard. She said: \"As we were walking the whole class together, I actually was speaking to the suspect Nikolas Cruz, and as I was speaking to him he seemed very, I don\u2019t know what the word I want to say is, but he was troubled in middle school. \"So, I kind of joked to him about it and said I\u2019m surprised you weren\u2019t the one who did it, and he just gave me a 'huh?'\" As the lockdown was lifted after the rampage, bewildered students and staff streamed out of the school with their hands in the air, passing heavily-armed and helmeted police officers wearing combat gear. Twelve of the dead were killed inside the school, while two others were shot just outside. One more was gunned down on the street, and two other victims died in hospital. The school, which has about 3,200 students, remained on lockdown for about 90 minutes before students were finally released and reunited with their distraught parents - who were anxiously waiting for updates - in emotional scenes. Cruz - described by former classmates as a \"troubled\" loner who was obsessed with guns - was arrested just after 4pm by police in nearby Coral Springs. He was wearing wine-colored Reserve Officers' Training Corps polo shirt, black pants and black boots. Police said Cruz, who worked at a local discount store and was attending a new school, was armed with an AR-15 rifle and had multiple magazines of ammunition when he was arrested without a struggle. Brent Black, a former classmate, told ABC News that Cruz had previously threatened to go on a shooting spree at the school. He said: \"About a year ago I saw him upset in the morning. And I was like, 'yo what\u2019s wrong with you?' \"And he was like 'umm, don\u2019t know.' And I was like 'what\u2019s up with you?' \"He's like, 'I swear to God I'll shoot up this school'. And then I was like, 'watch what you\u2019re saying around me', and then I just left him after that. He came up to me later on the day and apologised for what he said.\" Students told reporters that Cruz was familiar with the school's layout and had been involved in fire drills in the past, so he knew what to expect when the alarm went off. Attorney Jim Lewis told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that the AR-15 used in the mass shooting was legally bought by Cruz, who lived with a family friend following his mum Lynda 's death. A source told CNN that Cruz had purchased the gun in the past year after passing a background check. Cruz's adoptive mum died in November at age 68 from pneumonia, while his dad Roger died from a heart attack when he was a younger boy, it was reported. The couple had reportedly adopted Cruz on the day he was born, along with his biological brother, Zachary. Speaking on behalf of the family friend, Lewis said: \u201cIt was his gun. The family made him keep it in a locked gun cabinet in the house but he had a key.\u201d", "Lewis said the family let Cruz move in around Thanksgiving, gave him a room and urged him to attend adult education classes. The lawyer said Cruz was \"depressed\" following his mum's death, and the family who took him in \"didn\u2019t see this coming\". A relative told US media that Cruz had been diagnosed with autism. Following his arrest, Cruz was questioned for hours by detectives before he was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. Officers searched a number of properties linked to the suspect, including the home where he was living with a family friend. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security were assisting with the investigation. Former classmates claim he had previously threatened to shoot up the school, he had talked about shooting animals and he was obsessed with guns. They also said he had a bad school record and was expelled from Douglas High School after getting into a fight with his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend. Broward County School District Superintendent Robert Runcie told reporters he did not know of any threats posed by Cruz to the school. But maths teacher Jim Gard told the Miami Herald that he believes the school had sent out an email warning teachers that Cruz should not be allowed on campus with a backpack. He added: \"There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus.\" Photos posted on Cruz's Instagram account showed him posing with guns and knives. Police have described the social media posts as \u201cvery, very disturbing\". It also emerged that a YouTube user called 'Nikolas Cruz' had written chilling comments on videos just months ago. One comment under a documentary about the 1966 Texas University massacre read \"I am going to what he did\" [sic]. Another YouTube user claims someone with the handle 'Nikolas Cruz' commented on one of his videos last year, writing: \"I want to be a professional school shooter.\" The FBI were alerted to that post in September and carried out an investigation, but it was unclear what, if anything, happened from there. When Cruz was a freshman he was part of the US military-sponsored Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corp programme at the school. In an interview with Reuters, Jillian Davis, 19, a recent graduate who was in the programme with Cruz, recalled his \"strange talking sometimes about knives and guns\", but said \"no one ever took him seriously\". Chad Williams, 18, described Cruz as \"kind of an outcast\" who was \"crazy about guns\" and was known for unruly behavior at school, including a penchant for pulling false fire alarms. Trevor Hart, who had been in a Spanish class with Cruz, told the Orlando Sentinel that the 19-year-old seemed \"a little off\" and had talked about shooting lizards, squirrels and frogs. Former schoolmate Alex Azar told CBS Miami: \"He always seemed like the unstable type, the type who would do this sort of thing. He was always in the office. He was always in trouble, very unstable. He had that look to him, kind of sinister.\" Former neighbour Shelby Speno told how police were called to Cruz's home numerous times and he had been seen shooting at a fellow neighbour's chickens. Another former neighbour, Janine Kartiganer, added: \u201cHe wore a hoodie and always had his head down. He looked depressed.\u201d", "Wednesday's shooting ranked as the ninth-deadliest mass shooting in modern US history and the second-deadliest act of gun violence ever on a US public school campus, behind the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. In that incident, deranged gunman Adam Lanza, 20, killed 20 children aged six and seven and six adult staff members after killing his mum Nancy at their home in the town. Lanza shot and killed himself as emergency services arrived at the scene. The number of school shootings in the US has steadily increased in recent years, and the Parkland shooting is just the latest chapter in the longtime debate over preventative measures, including gun control. There were fresh calls for the US government to do more to prevent similar tragedies. US President Donald Trump didn't mention any potential preventative measures in his response to the attack. He appeared to suggest that those who were aware of the warning signs didn't do enough to alert authorities beforehand. He wrote on Twitter: \"So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!\" In earlier tweets, he wrote: \"My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school. \"Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.\" Reports from the US indicated that local police had dealt with Cruz on several occasions, he had been kicked out of school and staff were warned about him, and the FBI had investigated the \"professional school shooter\" comment that appeared to be posted by him on YouTube. As well, CNN reported that Cruz was able to purchase an assault rifle after passing a background check. Joe Melita, former head of the Professional Standards & Special Investigative Unit at Broward County Public Schools, told Action News Jax that that several district security officials were aware of Cruz", "He added: \u201cThey were familiar with who the young man was.\u201d", "Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted: \"I am at a loss for what more to say. I grieve with the families in Parkland today. I grieve with the families across the country who have suffered loss due to gun violence. Congress has a moral obligation to take action and spare more families from this violence.\" Meanwhile there have been 18 school shootings in the US already this year, an average of one every 2.5 days. At this time last year there had been seven, US media reported. According to Gun Violence Archive, there have been 30 mass shootings since January 1, or one every 1.5 days. Wednesday's school shooting occurred about 20 months after mass killer Omar Mateen, 29, murdered 49 people at a gay nightclub, called Pulse, in Orlando Florida. His rampage ended when he was shot dead by police. The June 2016 massacre was the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history until gunman Stephen Paddock, 64, killed 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas last October. Paddock shot and killed himself before police stormed the Mandalay Bay hotel room he had used into a sniper's perch.

According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint. Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home. Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down. When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as \u2013 Enya\u2019s \u2018Who Can Say\u2019. Crime Scene Photo of residence at 3845 Toolson Lane courtesy of Vernal Heights Police Department. After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house. The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home\u2019s basement. According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement\u2019s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.
